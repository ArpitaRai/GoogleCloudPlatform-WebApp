# Welcome to **GoogleCloudPlatform-WebApp** by Arpita Rai!  

This organization hosts a comprehensive **Cloud Native Web Application** project, comprising three interconnected repositories designed to deliver a seamless and scalable user experience.  

---

## Project Overview  

The **Cloud Native Web Application** project is built around three core components:  

1. **Web Application**  
2. **Serverless Infrastructure**  
3. **Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**  

These components work together to provide robust features such as user registration, authentication, infrastructure automation, and serverless functionality.

## Repositories  

### 1. **Web Application Repository**  
**[Repository Link: Web Application Repository](https://github.com/ArpitaRai/GCP-webapp)**  

**Description:**  
- Developed **Node.js CRUD APIs** for managing user registration and profiles.  
- Integrated **Sequelize ORM** for efficient database operations.  
- Implemented secure **OAuth2 authentication** to safeguard user interactions.  
- Automated CI/CD workflows using **GitHub Actions** for tasks such as image builds, template validation, integration testing, and deployments.  

---

### 2. **Serverless Infrastructure Repository**  
**[Repository Link: Serverless Infrastructure Repository](https://github.com/ArpitaRai/serverless)**  

**Description:**  
- Created **serverless Cloud Functions**, triggered by Pub/Sub, to send user verification emails via **Mailgun**.  
- Leveraged serverless architecture for enhanced scalability and resource optimization.  

---

### 3. **Terraform IaC Repository**  
**[Repository Link: Terraform IaC Repository](https://github.com/ArpitaRai/tf-gcp-infra)**  

**Description:**  
- Automated the setup of **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** infrastructure using **Terraform**.  
- Managed key resources such as **KMS**, **IAM**, **Cloud SQL**, **DNS**, **Logging**, **Autoscaling**, and **Load Balancing**.  
- Built custom **VM images** with pre-installed dependencies using **Packer**.  

---

## Key Features and Technologies  

- **Node.js**: Enables server-side JavaScript development for the web application.  
- **Sequelize ORM**: Simplifies database management with an efficient ORM layer.  
- **Packer**: Automates the creation of VM images with required dependencies.  
- **Terraform**: Manages cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  
- **GitHub Actions**: Streamlines CI/CD workflows, including testing and deployment.  
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Powers scalable and reliable cloud infrastructure.  
- **Mailgun**: Provides email services for sending user verification emails.  
- **Serverless Functions**: Lightweight, event-driven functions for asynchronous task handling.
